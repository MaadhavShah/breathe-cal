i think for this iteration. just want mostly the proof of concept dealio

so if i get a response from the API, THEN i write it into database ja?




plans:
1. locations API -> use this to get the locationKey
  save location key into database
  before making the api call, check database if location exists, etc. prefer postal code i think? 
  
2. use the forecast api w/ the location key to get the weather forecast.
  possibly store information in database 
  e.g.
  lets see what kind of tableage do i want
  
  city -> forecast, 
  
  
  
so a city has zip, has location key. daily info object? 
  
  



=end
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
end
