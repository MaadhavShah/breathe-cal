Feature: client searches 
  As an allergy sufferer with a user account
  in order to know what cities I have recently searched for, 
  I should see the last 5 cities I searched for at the bottom of the sidebar on the landing page.

# TODO - commented sections -> view is not being populated with new data, although search is being made
# not consistent with heroku deployment. 
# issues with capybara testing + asynchronous javascript


@javascript   
Scenario: I should see a blank search history before having searched for anything
    Given I am on the landing page
    Then I should see "No recent searches"

@javascript   
Scenario: Having searched for a city I should see it displayed on the page
    Given I go to the landing page
    And my location is set to "Kansas City"
    And I follow "Back" 
    Then I should see "Kansas City"
    Then I should not see "Vancouver"
    Then I should not see "Boston"
    # When I follow a recently searched link: "Kansas City"
    # Then I should see the details of "Berkeley"
    

@javascript   
Scenario: Having searched for two cities I should see the most recent one on top
    Given I go to the landing page
    And my location is set to "Berkeley"
    And I follow "Back"
    And my location is set to "Albany"
    And I follow "Back"
    Then I expect to see "Albany" before "Berkeley"
    Then I expect to see a list of cities
    #Then I should see a link "Berkeley"
    #Then I should see a link "Albany"
    
@javascript
Scenario: Having searched for cities, I should retain my recent searches even if I go to the details page
    Given I go to the landing page
    And my location is set to "Berkeley"
    And I follow "Back"
    And my location is set to "New York"
    And I follow "Back"
    Then I should see "Berkeley"
    Then I should see "New York"
    #And I follow a recently searched link: "Berkeley" 
    #And I follow "Back"

@javascript    
Scenario: Having searched for more than 5 cities I should only see the last 5 ones displayed
    Given I go to the landing page
    #And I visit multiple locations: Berkeley, Albany, Oakland, Richmond, San Jose, Los Angeles
    And my location is set to "Berkeley"
    And I follow "Back"
    And my location is set to "Albany"
    And I follow "Back"
    And my location is set to "Oakland"
    And I follow "Back"
    And my location is set to "Richmond"
    And I follow "Back"
    And my location is set to "San Jose"
    And I follow "Back"
    And my location is set to "Los Angeles"
    And I follow "Back"
    And I wait for page to load
    Then I expect to see a list of cities
    And I go to the landing page
    # Then I should see "Albany"
    # Then I should see "Oakland"
    # Then I should see "Richmond"
    # Then I should see "San Jose"
    # Then I should see "Los Angeles"
    # Then I should not see "Berkeley"
