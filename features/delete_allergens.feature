 Feature:
  As an allergy sufferer, in order to know the allergen information for
  my location, I should be able to add and delete allergens on the map.
  
Background: # (FAILS)
  Given I am on the landing page
  And I add a dog allergen
  
# TODO:

# Add and edit an allergen on the map, see edits (FAILS)
# Scenario: Once I've loaded the app and added an allergen, I should be able to edit the allergen.
#   Given I add a dog allergen
#   And I click on the allergen
#   And I click the edit allergen button
#   And I should be able to see the allergen details
#   When I fill in title with cat
#   And I check cat
#   And I press submit
#   Then I should see the updated allergen on the map
