As an allergy sufferer in order to know the allergen data and weather data, I should be able to clearly be able to visualize the data (utilizing colors and graphs)  and be able to clearly understand the information on the page. 

Finished: Add CSS and Bootstrap to Map/Search page
Finished: Visualize data from the accruweather api
Finished: Create icons and logos that provide users with data with quick glances e.x. low mid and high pollen and allergy levels and sunny cloudy rainy
Finished: display the current day and time
Did not finish: Make the Map/Search page responsive to a Mobile view. (We are anle to optimize the view for Desktop but not for mobile and we plan to build a new view for mobile to optimize the user experience for mobile. Its hard to make the google map responsiveness)
