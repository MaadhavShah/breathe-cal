Feature: Crowd_Sourcing
  Unfinished - currently any user can create a marker and assign attriutes to them.
  the markers are saved to a database. running into a minor issue w/ lazy loading and getting
  markers efficiently. 
  A user can - add a marker to the map
  A user can drag the marker around to place the marker more precisely
  A user can check off a precurated list of allergens that are saved w/ a marker
  - still to do -> authorization of placing a marker for authenticated users.
  - this feature was a lot larger and more complex than expected and probably could have been split
